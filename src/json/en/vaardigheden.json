      "description": "You can heal ‘Other Beings’ with your healer skills or healing spells. \nThese are beings such as Servitars, Spirits, Elementals, Undead, etc. A character that is another being always has a condition that explicitly states this. These beings are usually not healable without this skill. Also, potions, items, and scrolls cannot heal these beings unless explicitly stated. A healer with this skill can use a DISCERN spell or the diagnostics skill to determine if the recipient is an OTHER BEING. DISCERN spells are Discern Wounds, Discern Diseases, Discern Afflictions, and Discern Poisons. The caster can then heal the being by modifying their regular incantation and including the words ‘other being’ in the second part of the incantation. This modified incantation cannot heal a non-’other being’.",
