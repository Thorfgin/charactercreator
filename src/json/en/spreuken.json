The avatar attempts to fight as many \"unnatural\" influences on the flow of souls as possible, such as undead, servitars influencing the material world, and even spirits present on the material world (though it sometimes makes exceptions for invited nature spirits since they also strengthen the cycles). The avatar will generally assist the friends of the body it inhabits as long as they pursue this goal. A discern soul detects 2 souls in the recipient's body (one of which is a spirit). A detect spirit spell also detects this. A break minor possession spell ends this spell. \\n\\nThe recipient gains 3 extra hitpoints until the next sunrise, can cast detect impurity for free, and can reveal all impurities or break minor possession for 1 energy of their choice. Finally, the recipient can strike with a BLAST with any weapon longer than 45cm on undead, servitars, spirits, or bodies possessed by these creatures, per minute. The presence of an avatar of the cycle can be a powerful symbol in some rituals concerning the flow of souls and exorcism rituals. \\n\\nThe recipient will attempt to find and fight undead, servitars, or spirits. They want to break at least 1 possession (caused by enemies) or kill/destroy 1 undead, servitar, or spirit in the material world. If this is not done before this spell's effect ends, the recipient loses 5 energy of their choice immediately. If this energy is no longer present, the recipient will immediately be dying, and can only be healed if the missing energy is paid by others who touch the recipient. \\n\\nThis is a grove spell, after casting this spell the druid must return to their personal grove before casting another grove spell.",
